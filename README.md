# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-NLP
NLP-based Sentiment Analysis project for automated text opinion mining and sentiment classification.
Introduction

This project implements Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to automatically classify text data (like tweets, product reviews, or movie reviews) into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This can help businesses, researchers, or developers understand opinions and trends from large volumes of text data.

Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains text samples along with sentiment labels.

Source: [Insert dataset link, e.g., Kaggle or your source]

Features:

text: The textual data

label: Sentiment class (positive, negative, neutral)

Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, lowercasing, and stopword removal.

Model Training

The project uses [Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LSTM, BERT] to classify sentiment.
Steps:

Preprocess text data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization).

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train the model on training data.

Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Example code snippet
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(texts, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Vectorize text
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)
Model Prediction

The trained model can predict sentiment for new text inputs.
# Example prediction
sample_text = ["I love this product!"]
sample_vec = vectorizer.transform(sample_text)
prediction = model.predict(sample_vec)
print("Sentiment:", prediction[0])

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how NLP and machine learning can be applied to automatically detect sentiment from text data. The model provides a quick and effective way to analyze opinions, customer feedback, or social media data.

Possible Extensions

Use deep learning models like LSTM, GRU, or BERT for improved accuracy.

Add multi-language sentiment analysis support.

Deploy the model with Flask or Streamlit to create a web application.

Integrate real-time data streaming (e.g., Twitter API) for live sentiment analysis.
